## HI Internaut, this is my Portfolio.
My name is Pablo Sanchez (AKA "Manoloon"), Game programmer and enthusiast of learning everything about games. 

I start making games on Gamemaker 1.2 but then jump on UE4 , and fall in love with the whole engine, specially with Blueprints.

Once I feel comfortable with Blueprints I start learning C++ code.
My main project is Occultum , a third person shooter set in Buenos Aires, I am the programmer in the group.

I also participate in jams, generally I run solo on them.
